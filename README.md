Writing an expose document on rex sniper and TAP (Time and places)

devin.#1234


Rex snipe bot is a complete scam. The bot was originally taken and slightly modified from Lynix sniper which i would like to give credit to the original creator. Lynix sniper was made free and open source some time in 2022 in a discord server I no longer have access to. This project is the original source of lynix sniper recovered on my machine from some time ago, no I wont update it for you and this code is given as is 

Proof: 

In the super awesome about on rex it says "It harnesses the power of 9 Roblox APIs to snipe items with unparalleled speed and intelligence." Lynix sniper uses exactly 9 (completed) apis. Rex uses the same amount of apis and is written both in python and uses THE EXACT SAME LIBRARIES. Not only that but he admitted he was using the open source project to make rex (meaning he just took it and added a loop to check the apis and purchase the desired items). Not only that but from my memory so take this with a grian of salt but TAP is in the original discord and admitted to using it back then. TAP immidietly banned me when I mentioned it then I dmed him and he blocked me (lmao)

Legal action:

Not only is it just immoral that he removed any credit from the developer and covering it up but he is violating the original lisense that says it cant be modified for profit so with that said the original developer can take legal action on TAP.

How can I help: 

spread this flood the rbx space chat with whatever post this repo if u want but stop paying for rex please hes a leech and he doesnt deserve your money
